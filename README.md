# Is-the-Mushroom-Poisonous

1. Load the data.  
2. Separate the target, y and features, X from the dataset.  
3. Recode the target y, so that poisonous mushrooms are represented as 1 and edible mushrooms as 0.  
4. Transform the columns of the feature set X into a numpy array with a binary representation i.e, one-hot encoding.  
5. Conduct both a grid search to find an optimal hyperparameterization for a random forest classifier. Using accuracy as your method of model evaluation.  
6. Plot the mean test score versus hyperparameterization for the top 10 models found using grid search.
